My name is Arnau, but on the internet I'm *Arnau478*.

I started programming in 2016, but I really started taking it seriously in 2019.

Right now, I am developing [Quark](https://github.com/Arnau478/quark), an open-source operating system inspired by unix-like OSes. It's just a hobby for now, so I work on it when I can.

On the past, I've made a few compilers and interpreters. The most successful of all was [Opulus](https://github.com/Arnau478/opulus).

I switched from Windows to Linux on January 2022. Specifically, I now use [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) (based on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)). It really helps me as the main thing I do in my free time is coding!

I really like C, as it provides all the necessary tools to build low-level software.

And that's pretty much everything! Do you want to see [my blog](/blog)?
