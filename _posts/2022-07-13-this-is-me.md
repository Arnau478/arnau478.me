Well... My name is Arnau, I love Linux and C. But you can check all that stuff out on the [about](/about) page, so i'm not going to talk about all that right now. What I want to talk about is this website.

But...

# Why?

I really needed a website, so I finally decided to do it.

# How?

At first, I wanted to do it in pure HTML+CSS, to showcase my programming skills in that languages. But in the end, it was going to take up so much time I wouldn't have had time to focus on my main projects.

I started searching for an alternative, and I found [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which seems interesting to use.

# What next?

I will continue to work on this website when I can, and I would really like to write some posts. But for now, that's all I have!
